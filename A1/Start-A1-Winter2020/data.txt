Self-portrait in a Straw Hat
By Louise Elisabeth Lebrun


The painting appears, after cleaning, to be an autograph replica of a picture,
the original of which was painted in Brussels in 1782 in free imitation of
Rubens's 'Chapeau de Paille', which LeBrun had seen in Antwerp. It was 
exhibited in Paris in 1782 at the Salon de la Correspondance. 
LeBrun's original is recorded in a private collection in France.
